Within RNET, we will focus on building a number of AI related products that can be used as part of our offering to businesses, as well as stand-alone products. While initially, our data layer will draw upon information sourced from RX, contributed by users, our mid-term strategy prioritizes third-party entities as the primary data source. This strategic shift aims to enable any AI agent to consume information within our data repository or engage in inter-agent communication. Leveraging the capabilities of Axelar, our platform will facilitate cross-chain solutions, positioning it as a central nexus within the broader crypto ecosystem.",
